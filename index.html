				<p>How does this work?</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="step">1. Choose a Random Race</p>
				<p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character races are Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans (however, this generator uses all possible races). Some races also have subraces, such as Mountain-Dwarf or Wood-Elf.<span class="superscript">1</span></p>
				<p class="step">2. Choose a Random Class</p>
				<p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a characterâ€™s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.<span class="superscript">2</span></p>
				<p class="step">3. Roll Random Ability Scores</p>
				<p>There are six abilities - Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma - and your character receives a score for each, which determines his or her ability to perform various actions.</p>
				<p>Your character's six ability scores are generated randomly. Four 6-sided "dice" are rolled and the total of the highest three numbers are recorded. This is done five more times creating 6 random scores, one for each ability.</p>
				<p>The random scores are ordered highest to lowest, and, because the importance of abilities depends on which class was generated, the abilities are sorted by most important, then randomized non-essential abilties, then least important ability. For example, if you roll a Barbarian, your most important ability is Strength; Dexterity, Constituation and Charisma are non-essential; and Wisdom is the least important.</p>
				<p class="step">4. Add Racial Modifiers to Ability Scores</p>
				<p>Each race receives bonuses to certain abilities. After the abilities and scores have been sorted, your scores are modified based on which bonuses your race receives.</p>
				<p class="step">5. Calculate Modifiers</p>
				<p>Once everything has been calculated, ability modifiers are determined by subtracting 10 from each score and then dividing the result by 2 (rounding down).</p>
